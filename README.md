Medical Assistant Chatbot

Team: HealthTech Innovators

Team Members: Andrew Ulahannan Biju, Benyamin Aby, Rahul Thadathil

Problem Statement

The core issue is the lack of accessible, reliable, and quick medical guidance for everyday health concerns.
Patients often rely on random internet searches, which can be misleading and unsafe.
This matters because timely and accurate medical information can reduce panic, guide early intervention, and improve healthcare access for people without immediate access to doctors.

Proposed Solution

An interactive Medical Assistant Chatbot that provides instant health advice, medication information, and preventive care tips.
Key features include:

Local knowledge base with common symptoms and diseases.

Integration with free medical APIs like RxNorm, DailyMed, OpenFDA, and MyHealthfinder.

Emergency detection to alert users when symptoms may be serious.

Medication usage and caution details.
This directly solves the problem by combining verified health data with a user-friendly chatbot interface.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: None (API-driven with external medical services)

Business Model / Use Case

Target audience: Individuals seeking quick health information, students, and rural communities with limited healthcare access.
Monetization: Could be scaled into a subscription-based premium health assistant with doctor consultations or integrated into telemedicine platforms.
Real-world impact: Provides accessible, accurate, and cost-free health guidance, potentially reducing unnecessary hospital visits and improving preventive care awareness.

Conclusion & Future Scope

Current status: A working medical chatbot prototype with integrated APIs and a knowledge base for common diseases.
Future improvements: AI-driven symptom checker, multi-language support, hospital/clinic integration, and voice-enabled chatbot.
Closing statement: This project aims to democratize healthcare knowledge by making reliable medical guidance accessible to everyone, anywhere, anytime.
